This project is a simplified Employee Management System built using JavaScript classes, constructors, and inheritance.
It demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts such as:

Encapsulation (storing employee details inside classes)

Inheritance (Manager extends Employee)

Method overriding (custom describe() for Managers)

The project models real-world business hierarchies by representing Employees, Managers, and a Company.
